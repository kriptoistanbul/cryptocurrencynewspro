<h1>What is Cosmos (ATOM)?</h1>
<p>Cosmos is a blockchain network that aims&nbsp;<strong>to create a network of cryptocurrencies</strong>&nbsp;connected by code that will streamline cryptocurrency transactions.&nbsp;ATOM is a cryptocurrency native to this platform and powered by Cosmos Hub, a proof-of-stake blockchain.</p>
<p>In this article we will talk about what exactly is behind the project and how Cosmos works.&nbsp;Furthermore, we give a detailed&nbsp;<strong>Cosmos purchase instructions</strong>&nbsp;and look at the course history so far.&nbsp;Finally, we make a forecast of how ATOM will potentially develop in the future and whether an investment is worthwhile.</p>
<div>

<p>Cosmos is a blockchain network that aims to enable independent blockchains to communicate with each other in a seamless manner.&nbsp;This allows them&nbsp;<strong>to exchange data and conduct transactions</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main problem that Cosmos solves is the lack of interoperability in the market.&nbsp;The Cosmos blockchain aims to provide an ecosystem in which dApps from different blockchain networks&nbsp;<strong>can communicate seamlessly with each other</strong>.</p>
<p>Cosmos began years before its release date.&nbsp;This platform came about when developer Jae Kwon&nbsp;<strong>introduced Tendermint to the industry in 2014</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;In April 2017, Cosmos secured this success through an ICO and it took the platform less than an hour to reach its goal.&nbsp;In December 2018 the network started testing and after a few months the main network of Cosmos was launched.</p>
<h2>Buy Cosmos (ATOM) &ndash; What you should pay attention to</h2>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Cosmos has a market cap of&nbsp;<strong>$2,123,070,921</strong>&nbsp;and has</li>
<li><strong>a total of 218,433,363.95 ATOMs</strong>&nbsp;in circulation.&nbsp;It is also one of the most popular cryptocurrencies worldwide for the innovation in the market.</li>
<li>Many users might find Cosmos (ATOM) attractive due to the approach and goal of facilitating interoperability between blockchains.&nbsp;Cosmos describes itself as &ldquo;&nbsp;<strong>Blockchain 3.0</strong>&nbsp;&rdquo;, has a user-friendly infrastructure and aims to ensure this user-friendliness for all of its users.</li>
<li>Another important point to note about Cosmos ATOM is its&nbsp;<strong>scalability</strong>&nbsp;, which means it can handle more transactions per second than any other type of blockchain.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What makes Cosmos (ATOM) special?</h2>
<p>What sets Cosmos apart from other types of projects is its focus on customization and interoperability.&nbsp;Cosmos fosters an ecosystem of networks where data and tokens are shared in a convenient way,&nbsp;<strong>without the need for a central party</strong>&nbsp;.&nbsp;All independent blockchains created within Cosmos are connected to the Cosmos Hub, which keeps track of the current status of each individual blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, Cosmos is needed in the market as the&nbsp;cryptocurrency&nbsp;industry needs&nbsp;<strong>some unification</strong>&nbsp;to ensure that all parties benefit positively, both the users, the community and the developers.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>Investing in ATOM allows you to vote on network updates.&nbsp;On the other hand, Cosmos (ATOM) rewards investors with a small percentage of the reward according to the tokens wagered.&nbsp;Therefore, the ATOM limit is adjustable depending on the amount of tokens invested.&nbsp;Additionally, ATOM's value may increase as more blockchain networks are built on this platform.&nbsp;The cryptocurrency is&nbsp;<strong>the 27th most valuable cryptocurrency in the world</strong>.</p>
<h3>The most important things in brief about Cosmos (ATOM)</h3>
<p>An important point to consider when investing in this cryptocurrency is that there are&nbsp;<strong>not many ways</strong>&nbsp;to access ATOM.&nbsp;The coin can be bought through certain providers like&nbsp;eToro&nbsp;which is one of the most recognized platforms.&nbsp;The currency can also be obtained through an exchange.&nbsp;With both methods, however, you need a wallet to exchange cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Cosmos (ATOM) has many advantages for investors, however, the investment area is extremely risky.&nbsp;With its goals, Cosmos (ATOM) can satisfy a great need in the blockchain area and is therefore something completely new for investors.&nbsp;It is a cryptocurrency with the&nbsp;<strong>potential to grow in the stock market</strong>.&nbsp;One thing that corrects this is that at least Binance has included this value showing the potential of Cosmos (ATOM).</p>
<h3>Do you need a Cosmos (ATOM) wallet?</h3>
<p>To safely invest in Cosmos (ATOM), you need an electronic wallet, better known as a&nbsp;crypto wallet&nbsp;.&nbsp;It is advisable to get one that suits the needs of the investor and can bring as much profit as possible.</p>
<p>This allows ATOM tokens to be easily and securely stored.&nbsp;The Cosmos wallet &ldquo;&nbsp;<strong>Comostation</strong>&nbsp;&rdquo; works as a universal wallet that securely protects assets and keeps token passwords private.</p>
<h3>What is Cosmos (ATOM) Mining?</h3>
<p>Mining is a process by which new coins are brought into circulation.&nbsp;This is done with the help of computers that solve extremely complex mathematical problems.&nbsp;Mining is extremely attractive to investors because it&nbsp;offers&nbsp;<strong>miners a reward for their work.&nbsp;</strong>These rewards are crypto tokens. </p>
<p>The newly mined cryptocurrencies are used for payment transactions, are circulated and thus other users of the network can buy cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;In this case, they are called &ldquo;&nbsp;<strong>validators</strong>&nbsp;&rdquo;, which correspond to the role of miners and receive compensation or block fees.</p>
<h3>Would you rather buy real Cosmos (ATOM) coins or Cosmos CFDs?</h3>

<h4>Cosmos CFD</h4>
<p>Another way to buy Cosmos ATOM are so-called CFDs or Contracts for Difference, which are offered on cryptocurrencies with a high market share.&nbsp;The trader does not physically buy the coins but makes a profit on the&nbsp;<strong>difference between the buy and sell price</strong>&nbsp;of the coins.&nbsp;Investors can invest in ATOM without having to receive it in the form of tokens.</p>
