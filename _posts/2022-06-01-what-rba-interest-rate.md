<h1 id="1">How austria-based coins were/will be affected by Reserve Bank of Australia raised interest rates</h1>
<p>In an unexpected move, the Reserve Bank of Australia raised interest rates in the wake of a worsening inflation outlook, while warning that further tightening of the monetary policy environment will follow.</p>
<p>There has been an increase in the official cash rate to 0.85% from 0.35%. This hike follows one conducted by the Reserve Bank of Australia in May, which was its first in more than a decade.</p>
<p>An increase of 25 basis points was expected by the majority of economists.</p>
<p>As a result of rising inflation in the first quarter, interest rates began to rise in May, and economists expect the situation to worsen in the coming months as elevated commodity prices, rising fuel and electricity costs, and soaring rent drive living expenses higher.</p>
<p>Global factors, including Covid-related disruptions to supply chains and the war in Ukraine, account for much of this increase in inflation, Mr. Lowe said.</p>
<p>But domestic factors are playing a role too, with capacity constraints in some sectors and a tight labor market contributing to the upward pressure on prices, he added.</p>
<p>Higher prices for electricity and gas and recent increases in petrol prices mean that inflation is likely to be higher than was expected a month ago, Mr. Lowe said.</p>
<p>Many economists have argued that the RBA should increase interest rates sooner in response to the inflation outlook.</p>
