<h3 id="4">What makes Audius special?</h3>
<p>By staking audio tokens on Audius, you are not only able to download songs and works from your favorite artists, but also participate in their success. If you choose to purchase Audius, you will gain twice: from the price gain of the Audius Coin as well as the income generated by crypto staking.</p>
<p>Additionally, Audius offers artists completely new opportunities for self-marketing that were previously only available through record companies and other intermediaries. The Audius platform, for example, can accommodate bonus tracks or unplugged versions, which can then be monetized on a per-song basis.&nbsp;Additionally, artists can create their own content nodes so they retain complete control over their work - something that was previously unimaginable in the traditional music industry.</p>
<p>With Audius, it will also be possible to provide fans with exclusive content that can be viewed only by fans with a certain level of loyalty, which is determined by Audius stakes. These may include behind-the-scenes impressions, unique video content, backstage passes, or face-to-face meetings.</p>
