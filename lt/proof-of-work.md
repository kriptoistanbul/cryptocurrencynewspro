<h1>What is Proof-of-Work</h1>
<P> <strong> Proof-of-Work is the basis for the algorithm used in Bitcoin (and other blockchains) and controls the generation of blocks. </strong> </p> <p> The proof-of-work system is due to <strong> Adam backs </strong> hashcash from 1997. In Hashcash, computers must build a <strong> arithmetical proof of work </strong> before they can send information. Hashcash was developed to limit email spam and denial-of service attacks by connecting the flooding of a network with messages. </p> <p> left more about proof-of-work at Bitcoin Mining </p>
