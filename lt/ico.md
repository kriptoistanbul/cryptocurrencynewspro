<h1>What is ICO (Initial Coin Offering)</h1>
<P> <strong> Initial Coin Offering (ICO) </strong> is a popular and unregulated method of collecting capital in the form of a token sale. </p> <p> A token or a coin is emitted by the company and offered at a fixed price in Fiat (e.g. USD, EUR) or other cryptocurrencies (e.g. BTC, ETH). </p> <P> Due to the unregulated surrender, this method was and is particularly popular with crypto startups to collect capital through crowdinvesting. But it also often led to abuse and fraud. </p>
