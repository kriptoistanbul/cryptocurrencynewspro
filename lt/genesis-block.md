<h1>What is Genesis Block</h1>
<p> The Genesis Block is the first block of a blockchain. </p> <p> The special thing about the Genesis Block at Bitcoin is the secret message (in the coin base). </p> <p> Satoshi Nakamoto left the following text: “<strong> The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on Brink of Second Bailout for Banks </strong>” </p> <P> Translation: Chancellor (Brit. Finance Minister) shortly before the second rescue operation for banks </p> <p> This text serves as proof that the block was also created on this day by referring to the title of the <strong> British newspaper The Times </strong>. </p> <p> This happened at the time of the global financial crisis, so that this message is also seen by many as a <strong> criticism of the previous financial system </strong>. </p>
