<h1>What is Hodl</h1>
<p> <strong>  Hodl  is slang and a battle cry in the Bitcoin community, which has become popular for  hold . </strong> </p> <p> Hodl is also used to express that you want to keep your Bitcoin stocks in the long term instead of selling them or acting at short notice. </p> <P> The use of the term goes back to a contribution in the Bitcoin Forum Bitciartalk.org in 2013, in which a user with the pseudonym  <strong> GameKyuubi </strong>  wrote that he would hold his Bitcoin instead of selling them. He wrote  <strong> i am Hodling </strong>  instead of  I am Holding . </p> <p> This post quickly became viral and led to  Hodl  becoming a common term in the Bitcoin community. The term is also used for other cryptocurrencies from time to time, but has its origin at Bitcoin. </p>
