<h1>What is Defi</h1>

<p> Defi is the abbreviation for decentralized financial markets. These are decentralized applications (DAPPS) that are supposed to replace central financial intermediaries such as stock exchange brokers and banks. </p> <p> Defi applications are dependent on complex, programmable contracts (smart contracts). Smart Contract platforms such as Ethereum are therefore more suitable than simple, less well programmable blockchains such as Bitcoin. </p>
