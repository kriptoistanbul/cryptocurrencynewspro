<h1>What is Hashrate</h1>
<p> <strong> The Hashrate is a central key figure for the computing power and size of the Bitcoin network (or other proof-of-work network). </strong> </p> <p> <strong> The higher the hashrate, the more miner try to mine the next block </strong>. The HASRATE is continuously climbing and leads to the individual miner who stand in the competition for other miners, to continuously increase and improve their hardware in order to maintain the chance to find the next block. </p>
