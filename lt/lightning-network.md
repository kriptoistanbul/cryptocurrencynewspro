<h1>What is Lightning Network</h1>
<p> The Lightning Network is an “off-chain” solution to solve the scaling problem at Bitcoin. So-called payment channels (Payment Channels) can be transferred back and forth between participants. <p> It works by creating an additional layer over the Bitcoin blockchain, on which transactions can be handled faster without having to confirm every transaction on the main chain. This means that users can carry out faster and cheaper transactions without affecting the safety or integrity of the Bitcoin blockchain. </p> <P> The Lightning Network is still an experimental protocol and there are still some challenges and risks that need to be mastered before all users can be fully implemented. </p>
