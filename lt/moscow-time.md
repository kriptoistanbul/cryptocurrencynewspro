<h1>What is Moscow Time (Bitcoin)</h1>
<p> The concept of  <strong> Moscow Time and Bitcoin </strong>  was known to the American government (House Committee) by a video call by Twitter boss Jack Dorsey. </p> <P> In the background of the video recording, an analog clock with the <strong> number 1952 </strong> was seen. Since it was just 9:52 a.m. in California at the time, some present speculated whether Jack Dorsey was in a different time zone. </p> <p> Chris Vickery suspected that Dorsey was in Moscow as it was in Moscow at that time. But that couldn't be, because Dorsey's windows seemed to be bright sunshine. </p> <p> Jack Dorsey has set up a  <strong> block clock </strong>  that shows the current Satoshi Prize in USD. A Satoshi is the smallest unit in the Bitcoin network and corresponds to 1/100000000 BTC. </p> <p> then follows that at the time of the video call <strong> 1 USD = 1952 Satoshis </strong>. The lower the value of the Bitcoin clock, the higher the Bitcoin price in USD. </p> <p> Jack Dorsey has once again shown himself as a big Bitcoin advocate and sent a secret message to the world. :-) </p>
