<h1>What is Blockchain</h1>

<p> <strong> A blockchain is a chain of all blocks ever generated. Each block created is hung on the previous one and a block chain is created. </strong> </p> <p> Each block has a unique block ID of the previous block in the block header. The block ID is a so -called <strong> hash </strong> that is calculated from many different parameters of the block (e.g. Nonce). </p> <p> A chain is caused by the link to the respective block IDS (block chain). </p> <p> Nobody can manipulate the data in a block and thus in the entire blockchain. </p> <p> Every network participant (Full Node) has saved a copy of the current blockchain. This decentralized data structure cannot be deleted either. </p> <p> These two circumstances make the blockchain a very safe, decentralized database. </p>
