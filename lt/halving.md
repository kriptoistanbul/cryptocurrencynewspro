<h1>What is Halving</h1>
<P> Every four years or every 210,000 blocks, the bitcoins generated per block reduces by 50%. At the beginning of 2009 there were <strong> 50 BTC per block </strong>. On May 13, 2020, the last time was automatically reduced from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC. </p> <p> <strong> Since a block is generated about every 10 minutes, every halving happens about every four years. </strong> </p> <p> For technical reasons it is never exactly four years, but it works as a rule of thumb. </p> <p> You can find a few videos about Bitcoin Halving here: </p>
