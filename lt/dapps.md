<h1>What is dApps</h1>

<p> <strong> dapps are decentralized applications </strong> that “run” on a blockchain. DAPPS save data stands accordingly decentrally and all network participants (full nodes) have a copy of it. </p> <p> dapps have become known primarily by the Ethereum platform. </p> <p> The advantage of decentralized applications is that data is relatively manipulation and fake-proof. However, the disadvantage is that data changes are much slower and more expensive than central database systems. </p>
