<h1>What is Mempool</h1>
<p> <strong> The Mempool at Bitcoin is a collection of transactions that have not yet been confirmed that are waiting on the Bitcoin network. </strong> </p> <P> If a user initates a Bitcoin transaction, it will first be sent to the Mempool, where they can be included in their blocks by Bitcoin (the participants of the Bitcoin network, which process and confirm the transactions). > <P> The Mempool therefore serves as a  <strong> queue  for unconfirmed transactions </strong> and ensure that these transactions are not lost while waiting for their confirmation. The Mempool is an important part of the Bitcoin network and enables transactions to be processed and confirmed efficiently. </p>
