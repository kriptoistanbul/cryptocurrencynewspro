<h1>What is Off Chain</h1>
<p> off chain refers to transactions that are only exchanged among the trading partners without being written to the blockchain. </p> <p> off chain stands for  <strong> outside the blockchain </strong> . They are the basis for Lightning network and atomic swaps. If something goes wrong, they can be distributed in the Bitcoin network (or the corresponding Altcoin network) and, if they are included in a block by a miner, turn into on-chain transactions. </p>
