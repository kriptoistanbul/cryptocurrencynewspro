<h1>What is Fiat Money>
<P> The term <strong> fiat money </strong> describes the state where the money is created solely by the decision of the legislative organs of a state and this money then determines this money as a legal means of payment. The banknotes are not in an inner value, but only a promise of the state about the value of the banknote. </p>
