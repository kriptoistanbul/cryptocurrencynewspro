<h1>What is IPO (Initial Public Offering)</h1>
<p> a <strong> IPO (initial public offering) </strong> is the first sale of <strong> shares of a company on the stock exchange </strong>. An IPO can receive a company of investors by selling part of its property rights to the public in the form of shares. </p> <P> An ICO (Initial Coin Offering), on the other hand, is a financing tool used by cryptocurrency companies to collect capital for their projects. At the ICO, the companies sell digital tokens based on blockchain technology. In contrast to shares, these tokens do not offer property rights to the company, but enable owners to use certain services within the company's platform. </p>
