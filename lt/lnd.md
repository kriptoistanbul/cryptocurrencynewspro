<h1>What is LND</h1>
<p> lnd stands for  <strong> Lightning Network daemon </strong> . It is a software design of the Lightning Network, a Layer 2 scaling solution for Bitcoin. </p> <P> The Lightning Network enables almost immediate and inexpensive transactions between two parties, without having to wait for the transactions on the underlying blockchain. </p> <p> This is achieved by creating payment channels between parties that can be updated outside the blockchain without the need for consensus in the entire network. </p> <p> <strong> lnd </strong> is one of several software plans of the Lightning Network and is developed by Lightning Labs. It is designed in such a way that it is easy to use for developers and users who want to create Lightning Network applications and use Lightning payments. </p> <p> <strong> lnd is an open source software and is available free of charge on Github. </p>
