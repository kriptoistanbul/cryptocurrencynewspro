<h1>What is Validator</h1>
<p> validators are called network participants who provide their assets to validate transactions in a proof-of-stake network. </p> <p> In Proof-of-Work networks, these participants are also called miners. </p> <p> <strong> A validator is a node in the network that checks and validated the validity of transactions proof-of-stake-network. </strong> </p> <p> validators are an important part of cryptocurrencies, since they ensure that transactions are carried out correctly and that <strong> do not exist double transactions </strong>. </p> <p> In networks such as Ethereum, each user can become a <strong> validator </strong> by depositing a certain amount of ether as security. This enables the network to remain decentralized and democratic, since every user has the opportunity to become part of the Validators network. </p> <P> Overall, validators are an essential part of cryptocurrencies, since they help ensure the safety, integrity and functionality of the network. They also help to maintain the trust of the users into the network by ensuring that all transactions are carried out correctly and that the network is protected against fraudulent activities. </p>
