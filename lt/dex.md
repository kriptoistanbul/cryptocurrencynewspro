<h1>What is DEX</h1>

<p> <strong> dex stands for Decentralized Exchange </strong>. </p> <p> A decentralized crypto tours allow users directly (<strong> peer-to-peer </strong>) and without exchanging coins and tokens without a middlemony. </p> <p> Since intermediaries such as crypto stock exchanges and brokers are largely necessary, no registration data is required for use as in the context of valued money laundering laws. </p> <P> There are still central components of a Dex. So it is common for the smart contract to be controlled and further developed by a central authority. It is decentralized via Atomic Swap. </p>
